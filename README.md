# Mask-detection
Face Mask detection using Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV.

Here I have used tranfer learning to train the MobileNetV2 model on a 4000 image dataset. Accuracy obtained was 99.7%. The caffe model was used to detect faces and our mask classifier was applied to the result. 

It is successful in detecting faces and masks in images and videos alike.
